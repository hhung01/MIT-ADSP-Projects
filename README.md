# Course Projects

[The MIT Applied Data Science Program](https://professional.mit.edu/course-catalog/applied-data-science-program-leveraging-ai-effective-decision-making) is part of MIT's Professional Education certificate program.

This repository contains the following course projects:

* Food Hub
* Amazon Product Recommendation System (Elective)
* Music Recommendation System (Capstone)

For the Capstone project, we were given a choice of projects which are focused on different domains taught in the course.  I chose the Recommendations Systems track.

The Capstone project itself is divided into two parts.  The first part is an Elective project.  Even though it was termed "Elective," it still needs to be completed in order to pass.  Part 2 is the actual Capstone project.  The project requirements include a notebook, a PowerPoint slide, and a live presentation.
